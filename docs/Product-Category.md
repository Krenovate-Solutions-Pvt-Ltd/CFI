##  **What is a Product Category?**

Product category is the most important key in how you present, organize and sell your products.

Key features about Product Category:

-   A category gives the opportunity to group products easily. A parent category can have multiple sub-categories.
-   Each category and/or subcategory is like a folder that contains:
    -   A list of products inside
    -   Other folders inside (sub-categories)
    -   Both a list of products and other folders inside
-   A product category is the key link in setting up programs/classes and further features.
-   Products/classes are placed "inside" categories, and customers can browse through each category to find products of interest.
-   All top level categories will be visible when a visitor first enters the main catalog
-   Sub-categories will only be visible when a user clicks on the "parent" category

A sample of a parent category and its sub-categories is shown below:
