### **Product Categories**

To club multiple Program Sections under a plan, assigning a Product Category to every Program section created is a key requirement.

**Under the Personal Fitness, each product created should have a sub-category with the same name.**

Follow the below steps to select category:

1.  Go to -> **Product Categories**
2.  Select -> **Personal Fitness** always as the Parent category.
3.  Select -> Sub-category with the same name as the Product.
